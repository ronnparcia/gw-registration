# Green & White Registration Form Script

Google Apps Script code for generating an account number and card (registration receipt) per registration form response. To run this script automatically, a on-form-submit trigger which runs the `addTicketNumber()` function must be created by the owner of the form, spreadsheet, and card template. Note that "ticket number" is the same as "account number."
